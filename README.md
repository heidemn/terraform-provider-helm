This is the [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) provider for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

The provider manages the installed [Charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) in your Kubernetes cluster, in the same way Helm does, through Terraform.


## Contents

* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [Getting Started](#getting-started)

-   [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) v3.x.x to deploy your charts

-	https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/

## Getting Started

This is a small example of how to install the mariadb chart on your default
kubernetes cluster, since the provider was initialized, all the configuration
is retrieved from the environment. Please read the [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/helm/index.html) for more
information.

You should have a local configured copy of [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

```hcl
provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    config_path = "~/.kube/config"
  }
}

resource helm_release nginx_ingress {
  name       = "nginx-ingress-controller"

  repository = "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"
  chart      = "nginx-ingress-controller"

  set {
    name  = "service.type"
    value = "ClusterIP"
  }
}
```
